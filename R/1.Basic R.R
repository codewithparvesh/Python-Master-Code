#R is a Statistical programming lang

#and it adds more functionality to it
x <- 12:19
y <- 34:35
z <- 2:12
sum(x,y,z)
 
#Basic Arithmetic ops
#R is case sensitive
#R will over right the variable
#By using  rm() we can remove the variable
rm(x)
#we can't start variable with numbers or spc char
1X<- "sa"
%X<- "sa"
7+8
5*6
9*2+2
#just use like a calculator
#abs() absolute value or pos int
#sqrt() sq root value 
#if we didn't end the code as syntax says it will return 
#+ sign
#+ %% is used for modulus
#+ & all element in the vector
#+ && first element in the vector
#+ | all element in the vector
#+ || first element in the vector
